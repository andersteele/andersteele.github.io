I am a mathematician/scientist interested in number theory and machine learning.  My work as a research mathematician has focused on the theme of explicit solutions to Diophantine problems. You can read more about that [here](/mathematics/). Currently, I am exploring applications of deep learning to problems in biology and applied mathematics.
